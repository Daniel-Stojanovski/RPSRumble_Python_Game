Concept:

Singleplayer/Multiplayer Third-Person Python Game based on Rock-Paper-Scissors.

The core concept of the game is set in a scenario where you pick one of the three character options, them being Rock, Paper, Scissors.
As their strengths and weaknesses are widely known, the motive behind the game is to eliminate the weaker characters than yourself,
and you do so by colliding into them, but also surviving by avoiding contact with stronger characters.

The goal is to create a fast-moving enviroment gameplay with some movement mechanics, like double-jumps, wall-jumps and dashes, and bounces (teammate collision).

Basic Alpha version should include Singleplayer Death-Match.
In terms of diversity, the game could include gamemodes, such as battleroyal (solo, duo, trio), team-fight(3 teams) and death-match (solo, team)
